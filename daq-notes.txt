The mydaq microcontroller has no onboard memory, so it has to be plugged into a pc to function.

outputSingleScan

sends voltage to output pins that are given a value of 1 in the array sent to the function eg;
outputSingleScan(s, [0 1 0 0]);
where s is the daq session ( s = daq.createSession('ni'); ).
this would power the 2nd pin to be declared an output.

inputSingleScan

reads values for all input pins designated should be used as a function of a variable eg;
data = inputSingleScan(s);
where s is the daq session ( s = daq.createSession('ni'); ).
if there are multiple input sources access, a particular input source with;
data(x)
where x is the position ih the order in which the inputs were declared.
