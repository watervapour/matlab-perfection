The mydaq microcontroller has no onboard memory, so it has to be plugged into a pc to function.


All code examples given in forms that work for the equipment projects use.

getDevices
d = daq.getDevices
only necessary if multiple daq devices are plugged into a single system, can be left out for project.


createSession
s = daq.createSession('ni')
the variable is used in the other daq function to refer to the device 'ni' refers to the vendor of the device


addDigitalChannel
s.addDigitalChannel('myDAQ1', channelID, I/O)
channelID given in form 'port0/line1' line can increment (such as mass declaring motor pins) line4:7
port0 is for digital pins (despite the switch inputs labeled as DI:x)
I/O use 'InputOnly' or 'OutputOnly' depending on purpose.


addAnalogChannel
follows same format as addDigitalChannel but uses port1
only used for the ligth sensors on the analog channels


outputSingleScan
sends voltage to output pins that are given a value of 1 in the array sent to the function eg;
outputSingleScan(s, [0 1 0 0]);
where s is the daq session ( s = daq.createSession('ni'); ).
this would power the 2nd pin to be declared an output.


inputSingleScan
reads values for all input pins designated should be used as a function of a variable eg;
data = inputSingleScan(s);
where s is the daq session ( s = daq.createSession('ni'); ).
if there are multiple input sources access, a particular input source with;
data(x)
where x is the position ih the order in which the inputs were declared.
